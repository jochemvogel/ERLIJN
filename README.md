## :gear: Installation

### Get it local

This app is made with vanilla JS (frontend) and NodeJS (backend).

#### 1). Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/jochemvogel/progressive-web-apps-2021.git `

#### 2). Install dependencies

`npm install`

#### 3). Get an API key

Go to [RapidApi.com](https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search) and click on **Sign Up** in the top right corner. When you've done this, return back to the previous URL and you can use the API. The API has no rate limit.

Copy the `.env.example` file, change the name to `.env` and update the value of the `API_KEY=` to the API key you got from RapidApi. Then set `IS_DEVELOPMENT` to true in your own `.env`.

#### 4). Start development environment

`npm run dev` (Will build & watch automatically)

#### 5). Watch files (manual)

`npm run watch`

#### 6). Build files (manual)

`npm run build`

## :open_file_folder: Folder Structure

### models

All the data is getting fetch (and processed) in this folder.

### views

All the (EJS) views can be found here. There is a `/pages` and a `/partials` folder located.

### controllers

The render controller is located in this folder. Controllers are the 'middleman' between the views & models and reacts to user interaction.

### routes

All the routes (with it's render functions) are located in `routes/routes.js`.

### scripts

Here are all the build scripts located.

### src

All the js, css and assets are located in this folder. When you build, those files will be optimized and placed in the `/public` folder. All the files in thet `src/assets/` folder will be place in the 'root' of `/public`. The rest will be placed in their dedicated folder.

### public

This folder is not visible (on default). After you build, the `/public` folder will be created.

## :package: API Endpoints Structure

What's inside the API (structure/objects).

The documentation and all the (interactive) endpoints kan be found [here](https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search).

Examples of the two used endpoints will be listed below:

### Places

This endpoint is used to fetch user friendly locations like **_Amsterdam_** to locations the Quotes endpoint understands like **_AMS-sky_**

#### Parameters

_query_: **Nederland**

_country_: **Nederland**

_currency_: **EUR**

_locale_: **nl-NL**

#### Output

```json
{
    "Places": [
        {
            "PlaceId": "NL-sky",

            "PlaceName": "Nederland",

            "CountryId": "NL-sky",

            "RegionId": "",

            "CityId": "-sky",

            "CountryName": "Nederland"
        },

        {
            "PlaceId": "AMS-sky",

            "PlaceName": "Amsterdam Schiphol",

            "CountryId": "NL-sky",

            "RegionId": "",

            "CityId": "AMST-sky",

            "CountryName": "Nederland"
        },

        {
            "PlaceId": "EIN-sky",

            "PlaceName": "Eindhoven",

            "CountryId": "NL-sky",

            "RegionId": "",

            "CityId": "EIND-sky",

            "CountryName": "Nederland"
        },

        {
            "3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9": "Same for: Rotterdam, Maastricht, Groningen etc."
        }
    ]
}
```

Small side note: It will list all the location that has the query in his name. For example: all the airports in `Caribisch Nederland` will also be included in the query `Nederland`. Be aware of that.

## :rocket: Optimisations

### Performance bingo

#### Optimising the critical rending path

Reducing the time that a browser needs for rendering the page.

#### First view

First View is all about optimising the first meaningful paint. It's (like the name suggests) the first time a user visits your page (without cookies & cache of course). Optimising for the First View means render something meaningful as soon as possible.

#### Repeat view

The Repeat View represents what someone will see if they are coming back to the page some time after visiting it the first time. The Repeat View is all about bytes and caching strategies.

#### Perceived performance

This is all about perception. How long does it takes (in de mind of the user) to load your application. You can 'improve' this by adding (small) animations/transitions that'll make you application looks smooth. The user thinks that loading will take less longer.

#### Runtime performance

This is about how the application performs while it's running. Does a button click gives the user immediate feedback or does it takes some time? Are routes loading fast or not?

#### Time to first byte

This is the time between the moment the user sends a request (i.e. a reload or a button click) and the moment that the first byte on the page is received (how fast does the server respond). If you have a pre rendered (static) site: this will be very fast. The server serves a static HTML file

#### First meaningful paint

This is all about the primary content. This is the moment that the biggest part of the 'above-the-fold' layout change has happened and the web fonts are loaded. It is when the website becomes useful.

#### Time to Interaction

This is the between the moment the user sends a request and the user is able to interact with the website.

### Optimisations I did

#### NPM Scripts

```json
"scripts":  {
	"start":  "node",
	"dev":  "nodemon & npm run build & npm run watch",
	"prebuild":  "rimraf ./public",
	"build":  "npm-run-all build:* && npm run revision",
	"build:css":  "node scripts/build-css.js",
	"build:js":  "node scripts/build-js.js",
	"build:assets":  "node scripts/build-assets.js",
	"build:img":  "node scripts/build-img.js",
	"build:revision":  "node scripts/revision/revision-hash.js",,
	"revision":  "node scripts/revision/replace-ejs.js & node scripts/revision/replace-sw.js",
	"watch":  "npm-run-all watch:*",
	"watch:css":  "chokidar \"src/css/*.css\" --c \"npm run build:css\"",
	"watch:js":  "chokidar \"src/js/*.js\" --c \"npm run build:js\"",
	"watch:assets":  "chokidar 'src/**/*.*' --command 'npm run build:static:assets'"
},
```

Most of the scripts are straight forward. The difference between `build:revision` and `revision` is that `build:revision` will make the `rev-manifest.json` and create the new versioned files, while `revision` rewrites the references in the header, footer & service worker. Not really satisfied with the naming, but I can't really come up with better names.

#### Build scripts

##### [`scripts/build-js.js`](https://github.com/jochemvogel/progressive-web-apps-2021/blob/master/scripts/build-js.js)

All the (client side) scripts are getting concatenated and minified (`terser`) to one file (`bundle.min.js`) and placed in the `public/js` directory.

##### [`scripts/build-css.js`](https://github.com/jochemvogel/progressive-web-apps-2021/blob/master/scripts/build-css.js)

First all the css is getting concatenated, then it's getting formatted (with cleanCSS) and eventually it's getting post processed (with autoprefixer). The bundled file will be placed in the `public/css` directory.

##### [`scripts/build-assets.js`](https://github.com/jochemvogel/progressive-web-apps-2021/blob/master/scripts/build-assets.js)

It copies all the assets and place it in the `/public` folder. There is also another script named `build-img.js`. It's basically doing the same, but it has a different output directory.

##### [`scripts/revision/revision-hash.js`](https://github.com/jochemvogel/progressive-web-apps-2021/blob/master/scripts/revision/revision-hash.js)

This file creates versioned files of the minified js and css for caching purposes. It also creates a `rev-manifest.json`, so other scripts can rewrite the references to those files based on the `rev-manifest.json`.

##### [`scripts/revision/replace-ejs.js`](https://github.com/jochemvogel/progressive-web-apps-2021/blob/master/scripts/revision/replace-ejs.js)

The references to `css/min.bundle.css` and `js/min.bundle.js` (in the header and footer) will be replaced to the hashed version.

##### [`scripts/revision/replace-sw.js`](https://github.com/jochemvogel/progressive-web-apps-2021/blob/master/scripts/revision/replace-sw.js)

The references to `css/min.bundle.css` and `js/min.bundle.js` (in the service worker) will be replaced to the hashed version. This is another file, because the target location (`/public`) differs from the ejs files.

### Local fonts

First I used Google Fonts (and their URL). I choose to use local fonts to reduce the amount of external style sheets. Thanks to [Google Webfonts Helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) the fonts are now served locally (improved the _performance_ on Lighthouse with 12 points ^^)

Because of that I received almost 100/100 in Lighthouse (see screenshot).
![Lighthouse result](https://i.ibb.co/jWy1jwM/Screenshot-2021-03-23-at-14-03-43.png)

The only three improvements were:

1.  Reduce initial server response time (Heroku thing)
2.  Preload key requests (No idea how to fix this. I use local fonts and it suggests to add `<link rel=preload>`, but that doesn't make sense).
3.  Eliminate render-blocking resources (Probably could something with splitting, but had no time to fix that).

I'm pretty satisfied, because without that heroku thing I will have 100/100. Worked hard to get the PWA section 100/100 as well, but didn't figure out how to redirect HTTP traffic automatically to HTTPS. Tried in Node (`res.redirect`), tried with a `.htaccess`, but nothing worked. Doesn't really matter, so did not spend too much time on it.

## :memo: Todo list

-   [ ] **Error handling**. Worked in the WAFS version of this app, but it doesn't work here, yet.

-   [ ] **Improve the forms**. It's not really user friendly right now. The forms are getting cleared after submission, but you don't want this. Those forms needs to be filled with previous data.

-   [ ] **Add store**. Working with cookies right now, but I prefer working with a global state (store). Nice challenge, because I've never build one by myself.

-   [ ] **Come up with new ideas and add those in the backlog**. Ongoing üôÉ

### Backlog

_Nice to have_-ideas. Won't add them in the todo list, because these are not todos, but just some ideas for improving the app. This list is chronologically ordered.

-   [ ] **Add a few sights that can be visited in the destination.** The unsplash API can be used for this.

-   [ ] **Let the user choose their currency**. It's standard EUR now, but why not make it dynamic.

-   [ ] **Let the user choose between only direct flights**. Maybe a checkbox and it can also be displayed on the details modal.

-   [ ] **Create loader and implement it on API calls.**

-   [ ] **Let users select their budget.**

-   [ ] **Autocomplete the location/airports.** This will improve the UX of the user and prevents the user from filling in the wrong location.

-   [ ] **Random city trip within the users' budget.** Just let them fill in a start point and generate a random city trip. Thinking about the details will come later.

-   [ ] **Think about the USP's.** Think about your users. Why would they choose for ERLIJN and not some other comparison app with more features. Deliver more than others do. What is the value proposition?
