The render controller is located in this folder. Controllers are the 'middleman' between the views & models and reacts to user interaction.

All the js, css and assets are located in this folder. When you build, those files will be optimized and placed in the `/public` folder.
### public
This folder is not visible (on default). After you build, the `/public` folder will be created.

## :package: API Endpoints Structure

What's inside the API (structure/objects).

The documentation and all the (interactive) endpoints kan be found [here](https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search).

Examples of the two used endpoints will be listed below:

### Places

This endpoint is used to fetch user friendly locations like **_Amsterdam_** to locations the Quotes endpoint understands like **_AMS-sky_**

#### Parameters

_query_: **Nederland**
_country_: **Nederland**
_currency_: **EUR**
_locale_: **nl-NL**

#### Output

```json
{
    "Places": [
        {
            "PlaceId": "NL-sky",
            "PlaceName": "Nederland",
            "CountryId": "NL-sky",
            "RegionId": "",
            "CityId": "-sky",
            "CountryName": "Nederland"
        },
        {
            "PlaceId": "AMS-sky",
            "PlaceName": "Amsterdam Schiphol",
            "CountryId": "NL-sky",
            "RegionId": "",
            "CityId": "AMST-sky",
            "CountryName": "Nederland"
        },
        {
            "PlaceId": "EIN-sky",
            "PlaceName": "Eindhoven",
            "CountryId": "NL-sky",
            "RegionId": "",
            "CityId": "EIND-sky",
            "CountryName": "Nederland"
        },
        {
            "3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9": "Same for: Rotterdam, Maastricht, Groningen etc."
        }
    ]
}
```

Small side note: It will list all the location that has the query in his name. For example: all the airports in `Caribisch Nederland` will also be included in the query `Nederland`. Be aware of that.

## :memo: Todo list
-   [ ] **Error handling**. Worked in the WAFS version of this app, but it doesn't work here, yet.
-   [ ] **Improve the forms**. It's not really user friendly right now. The forms are getting cleared after submission, but you don't want this. Those forms needs to be filled with previous data.
-   [ ] **Come up with new ideas and add those in the backlog**. Ongoing üôÉ

### Backlog

_Nice to have_-ideas. Won't add them in the todo list, because these are not todos, but just some ideas for improving the app. This list is chronologically ordered.

-   [ ] **Add a few sights that can be visited in the destination.** The unsplash API can be used for this.
-   [ ] **Let the user choose their currency**. It's standard EUR now, but why not make it dynamic.
-   [ ] **Let the user choose between only direct flights**. Maybe a checkbox and it can also be displayed on the details modal.
-   [ ] **Create loader and implement it on API calls.**
-   [ ] **Let users select their budget.**
-   [ ] **Autocomplete the location/airports.** This will improve the UX of the user and prevents the user from filling in the wrong location.
-   [ ] **Random city trip within the users' budget.** Just let them fill in a start point and generate a random city trip. Thinking about the details will come later.
-   [ ] **Think about the USP's.** Think about your users. Why would they choose for ERLIJN and not some other comparison app with more features. Deliver more than others do. What is the value proposition?
